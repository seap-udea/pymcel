Notes on the DE430 and DE431 Planet and Lunar Ephemerides C. Acton
                            8/15/2013

JPL's Solar System Dynamics Group has released two new planet
ephemeris files: DE430 and DE431.  Each contains ephemeris data for
the planet barycenters--Mercury through Pluto (NAIF ID codes 1 through
9), plus the Sun (10), the earth mass center (399) and the moon (301).
Also present are the Mercury and Venus mass centers--199 and 299
respectively--since these have the same locations as the respective
barycenters.

The difference between DE430 and DE431 is mainly in the dynamical
model for the Earth's Moon.  DE430 uses a more complete dynamical
model which produces a slightly more accurate ephemeris for the
Moon. However the dynamical model used for DE430 includes a model of
an excited lunar core/mantle rotation interaction which does not
extrapolate into the distant past well.  Therefore DE430 was
integrated over a limited time span. DE431 does not include the
excited core/mantle state so is less accurate for times near the
current epoch but is more accurate for the distant past.

The difference in the positions of the planets agree to better than
0.001 km over the time period covered by DE430, a difference which is
not statistically distinguished by the currently available data. The
difference in the lunar position is less than 0.01 km over the period
1950 to 2050.

As of the date of this posting DE430 is now considered the official
lunar/planetary ephemeris, suitable for all users/uses.

For those whose need of a planet ephemeris can be satisfied by the
DE430 time span, and for those in need of the most accurate
JPL-produced lunar ephemeris, DE430 is now considered the official
export ephemeris.
